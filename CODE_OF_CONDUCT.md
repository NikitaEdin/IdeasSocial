   - Any suggestions or discussions should be respectful, kind, and focused on constructive dialogue.

2. **Inclusivity and Open-Mindedness**  
   - I believe that great ideas can come from anyone, anywhere, and will not tolerate any form of discrimination based on race, gender, religion, or any other personal attribute.
   - I am committed to creating an inclusive environment where everyone feels safe to share their thoughts and learn without judgment.
